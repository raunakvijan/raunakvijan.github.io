<p>
  I am a second year masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at [Indiana University Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html) advised by [Dr. David Crandall](https://cs.indiana.edu/~djcran/).

  My interest lies in applying deep learning techniques to Vision, Speech and Language. For an overview please check out my projects section. I am particularly interest in the Generative models and their application to Style Transfer and Data Synthesis. I am currently researching on Greeting Card Layout Generation using models like Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders.
